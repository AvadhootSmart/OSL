Here are five possible viva questions and answers for an assignment on implementing the Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm using the **Banker's Algorithm** in C.

### 1. **What is the Banker's Algorithm, and how does it help in deadlock avoidance?**
   - **Answer:** The **Banker's Algorithm** is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that ensures the system is in a **safe state** by analyzing each request for resources before granting it. The algorithm simulates whether allocating resources will result in a safe or unsafe state. If granting the request leaves the system in a safe state (i.e., there is a sequence of processes that can finish without causing a deadlock), the request is granted. Otherwise, the request is denied to avoid potential deadlock. It requires knowledge of the maximum demand, allocation, and available resources for each process.

### 2. **What is a safe state in the context of the Banker's Algorithm, and why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** A **safe state** is a state in which there exists a sequence of processes such that each process can obtain the necessary resources, execute, and release resources, allowing the system to reach a state where all processes finish without causing a deadlock. This is important because, in a safe state, even if processes request resources, there will always be enough resources available to eventually allow all processes to complete, avoiding a deadlock situation.

### 3. **What are the key steps involved in the Banker's Algorithm to check for a safe state?**
   - **Answer:** The key steps involved in the Banker's Algorithm are:
     1. **Initialize**: The available resources, allocation matrix, and maximum demand matrix for each process are given.
     2. **Request Evaluation**: For each process that requests resources, check if the request is less than or equal to the available resources. If not, deny the request.
     3. **Temporary Allocation**: If the request is valid, simulate the allocation by temporarily updating the allocation matrix and available resources.
     4. **Safety Check**: After the temporary allocation, check if there exists a sequence of processes that can be executed with the available resources (by simulating process execution and resource release). If such a sequence exists, the system is in a safe state, and the request is granted.
     5. **Rollback**: If no safe sequence exists, the system reverts the temporary changes and denies the request.

### 4. **How does the Banker's Algorithm handle resource allocation requests from processes?**
   - **Answer:** When a process requests resources, the Banker's Algorithm first checks if the request is less than or equal to the available resources. If it is, it temporarily allocates the requested resources and updates the available resources and allocation matrices. After this, the algorithm checks if the system is still in a safe state by trying to find a safe sequence of processes that can finish with the current allocation. If a safe sequence exists, the request is granted. Otherwise, the system reverts the changes (rollback) and denies the request to avoid a potential deadlock.

### 5. **What is the difference between the Banker's Algorithm and the resource allocation graph method for deadlock avoidance?**
   - **Answer:** The **Banker's Algorithm** uses a set of matrices (Available, Allocation, and Maximum) to check for a safe state by simulating the allocation and evaluating if the system can eventually execute all processes. It requires detailed knowledge of each process's maximum resource needs and current allocation.
   
   In contrast, the **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)** method represents the system with a directed graph, where nodes represent processes and resources, and edges represent requests and allocations. It avoids deadlock by ensuring that no cycles form in the graph, indicating that a circular wait (a key condition for deadlock) does not exist.
   
   - **Banker's Algorithm** is more mathematical and involves checking for safe states, whereas **RAG** visually tracks resource allocations and requests to detect deadlock conditions dynamically.
