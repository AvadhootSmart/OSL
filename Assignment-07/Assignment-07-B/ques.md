Here are five possible viva questions and answers for an assignment on **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using Shared Memory (System V)**, specifically focusing on a **Client-Server** program where the **server** writes to a shared memory segment, and the **client** reads from it.

### 1. **What is shared memory, and how is it used for inter-process communication in System V IPC?**
   - **Answer:** **Shared memory** is a form of inter-process communication (IPC) that allows multiple processes to access a common region of memory. In System V IPC, shared memory segments are created by one process (usually the server), and other processes (such as clients) can attach to this shared memory to read from or write to it. This type of communication is efficient because processes communicate through memory rather than copying data between them using pipes or message queues, making shared memory suitable for fast data exchange between processes running on the same system.

### 2. **How does the server process create and write to the shared memory segment in this implementation?**
   - **Answer:** The **server process** follows these steps to create and write to the shared memory segment:
     1. **Create a shared memory segment** using `shmget()`. This system call returns a shared memory segment identifier.
     2. **Attach the shared memory segment** to the server’s address space using `shmat()`. This maps the shared memory segment into the server's virtual memory.
     3. **Write a message** into the shared memory by directly accessing the memory through the pointer returned by `shmat()`.
     4. Optionally, the server process can **detach** from the shared memory segment using `shmdt()` after writing the message.

### 3. **How does the client process read the message from the shared memory segment, and what are the steps involved?**
   - **Answer:** The **client process** follows these steps to read the message from the shared memory segment:
     1. **Attach to the shared memory segment** using `shmat()`, passing the shared memory segment identifier that was created by the server.
     2. **Read the message** from the shared memory, which the server has written. The client can access the data directly from the pointer returned by `shmat()`.
     3. After reading the message, the client may **detach** from the shared memory segment using `shmdt()` to release the memory.
     4. Optionally, the client can **destroy the shared memory segment** using `shmctl()` if it no longer needs the shared memory segment (typically done by the server or at the end of the client’s task).

### 4. **What are the main system calls used in System V shared memory IPC, and what do they do?**
   - **Answer:** The key system calls used for managing shared memory in System V IPC are:
     - **`shmget()`**: Creates or retrieves a shared memory segment. It returns a unique identifier for the segment.
     - **`shmat()`**: Attaches the shared memory segment to the process’s address space, allowing it to access the shared memory.
     - **`shmdt()`**: Detaches the shared memory segment from the process’s address space once the process is done accessing the memory.
     - **`shmctl()`**: Controls various attributes of the shared memory segment, such as marking it for destruction or obtaining its status.

### 5. **What are some potential issues when using shared memory for inter-process communication, and how can they be addressed?**
   - **Answer:** Some potential issues and their solutions are:
     - **Synchronization**: Since multiple processes can access the shared memory concurrently, there is a risk of **race conditions** where processes interfere with each other’s data. This can be addressed using **semaphores** or **mutexes** to coordinate access to shared memory and prevent simultaneous writes or reads.
     - **Memory Protection**: Shared memory does not provide automatic memory protection. If a process writes beyond its allocated region in the shared memory, it can overwrite the data of other processes. This can be avoided by carefully managing the size of the memory and ensuring that processes do not access memory they don't own.
     - **Cleanup**: Shared memory segments must be cleaned up after use. If not removed properly, shared memory segments can remain in the system, leading to resource leakage. This can be prevented by using `shmctl()` to remove the shared memory when it's no longer needed.
